Purpose:
The prupose of my application is to allow users to keep track of their personal list of movies they want to watch and movies they want to watch
and movies they have watched. The application is separated into two tabs for movies you have and haven't watched.

How to use:
Add: To add a movie simply type in the movie title and select a genre then hit add movie.
Edit: To edit select a movie edit the information at the top then hit the edit button.
Delete: Select a movie then hit the delete button.
Comments: Select a movie then click the comment button type in your comment and hit the add comment button. 
OMDB: To view information from the OMDB database select a movie then hit the OMDB Info Button. If that title exist in the database information
      about the movie and a poster will appear.
Watched?: The watched button allows you to transfer a move from the want to watch to the have watched section. Simply review the movie, and the
	  the movie will be transfered to the watched tab.
Review: The review button allows you to change your review of a movie and add your personal review of a movie. This button only exists on the 
	watched page.
Favorite: The favorite button allows you to favorite a movie, so you can sort by those movies and keep a list of favorites in the watched section.
Search: The search bar searches for movie titles that contain the searched key words.
Sort By: Allows you to sort by ascending or descending order based on title, genre, date (want to watch), or rating (watched).
Double Click: If you double click on a selected movie it will google search that movie. This feature allows you to quickly search up a movie
	      for even further information and ease of use.

File: You can save your movie lists into a file to be reviewed and stored for later. All the buttons in the file menu work as you would expect
      in other programs.

Packages or Libraries: I didn't use any packages or libraries to create this program.
